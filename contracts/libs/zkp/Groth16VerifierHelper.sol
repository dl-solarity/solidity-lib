/**
 * @notice This library is used to simplify the interaction with autogenerated contracts
 * that use [snarkjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snarkjs) to verify Groth16 ZK proofs.
 *
 * The main problem with these contracts is that the verification function always has the same signature, except for one parameter.
 * The `input` parameter is a static array `uint256`, the size of which depends on the number of public outputs of ZK proof,
 * therefore the signatures of the verification functions may be different for different schemes.
 *
 * With this library there is no need to create many different interfaces for each circuit.
 * Moreover, the library functions accept dynamic arrays of public signals, so you don't need to convert them manually to static ones.
