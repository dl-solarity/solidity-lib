Note:

- `CHANGELOG.md` top section contains a brief, user-facing summary of the change.
- Top H2 level is set to one of: `patch`, `minor`, `major`, `none`, or as discrabed in the RC flow.
  - `patch`: bug fixes and safe refactors
  - `minor`: backwards-compatible features
  - `major`: breaking changes
  - `none`: no release (docs/tests/CI/etc.)

RC flow:

- When current version is an RC (`x.y.z-rc.N`):
  - `rc`: create the next RC pre-release
  - `release`: finalize current RC to a stable release
  - `none`: include changes without altering the RC version
- When not in RC but preparing a pre-release:
  - `patch-rc` / `minor-rc` / `major-rc`: start an RC cycle for the respective version bump

Important:
- The top of `CHANGELOG.md` must follow this structure:

```
# Changelog

## [patch]   // or [minor], [rc], [patch-rc], [none], etc.
- Short description of the change.
```
